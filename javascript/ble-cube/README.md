## TODO
 
- apply different color to each edge of the cube
- highlight the edge when it is at the top
- apply shaders: https://threejs.org/examples/?q=bloom#webgl_postprocessing_unreal_bloom_selective  
- add neon light when the edge is highlighted
- control the cube's orientation with a roll/pitch via BLE
